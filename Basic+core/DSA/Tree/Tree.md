Tree = it is a tree that is not a forest
It is Another ADT (Abstract Data Type)

It HAve following properties:

It has a parent note that called Root Node
It has a child node that called Leaf Node

Tree have some type :- 
1. Strict Binary Tree  ==> It has Either two child node or No Child.

2. Full Binary Tree  ==> It has Both two child node with equals nodes OR all the leaf Node should be same Level.

3. Complete Binary Tree ==> It has both child node one of the child node should be leaf node and another child node should be non leaf node but should be L-1 (L is a first child leaf node).

Tree Traversal  ---------

1. In-order
2. Pre-order
3. Post-order

let's see the example of tree traversal  :- 
No's is :-  5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8

In-order Traversal :- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7,8
Pre-order Traversal :- 5, 3, 2, 4, 7,6,8
Post-order Traversal :- 2, 4, 3, 6, 8,
