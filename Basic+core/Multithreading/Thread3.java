// In this program we will learn mutation variable that is using two threads at a time
// Mutable Variable  = We can Change Value anywhere in the program
// UnMutable Variable  = We can not( fixed like constant ) Change Value anywhere in the program

// In this program we using mutable variable that is count that default value is 0

//  NOTE :- 👉👉👉  To Fix of all these issues we will use Synchronized keyword in class method--------👍👍
